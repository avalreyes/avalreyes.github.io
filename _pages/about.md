I am an early career researcher with a strong background in molecular biology and bioinformatics. I am passionate about combining my unique skill set of software engineering and proteomics in making meaningful contributions to science while tackling a variety of important biological questions. Currently I contribute to the Xu Lab and the Mass Spectrometry Facility at the Carnegie Institute of Science, Stanford. My research focus in the Xu Lab is exploring selective O-Fucose/O-GlucNAc modifications to dissect biological functions of target proteins, specifically alternative splicing protein complexes. In the Mass Spectrometry Facility, I manage the mass spectrometer and help develop methods in quantitative proteomics from the sample processing to the downstream bioinformatics.
